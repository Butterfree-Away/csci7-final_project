            How can we better understand Facebook controversies - specifically those related to war crimes, violence,
            and harmful data practices - over the past 10 years?
            <br/>
            This project aims to answer that question through using Python's matplotlib, pandas, and numpy libraries
            to construct a visual representation of Facebook's political mishaps over the last decade. Using a self-
            created csv file* [composed a sample of 50 randomly selected controversial events involving Facebook
            within the last decade], three key figures were generated for use in the project: a scatterplot depicting
            the number of major political Facebook Controversies over the last year, a timeline generated via a
            stemline plot, and a table of values.

               <p class="text-left py-7 mt-7 mb-7">
                  This scatterplot depicts the relationship between the frequency of controversies and the year.
                  As evident in the plot, the number of controversies that Facebook has been involved in has increased
                  overall in recent years. The largest increase in the number of reported events from this sample was
                  in 2018 ( a growth of 5). The infamous Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal occured during that year.
